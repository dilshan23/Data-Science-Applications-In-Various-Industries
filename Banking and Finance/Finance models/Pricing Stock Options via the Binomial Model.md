Pricing Stock Options via the Binomial Model
Though most of us are familiar with stocks on the stock market, we may not be quite as familiar with
the derivatives that are traded on similar markets. One such derivative is called an “option”. Options
are, essentially, the right to buy or sell a stock at a given price. These two types of options are known as
“call” and “put” options, respectively. For instance, I can buy a CALL option for AAPL (Apple) with
a strike price of $430.30 dollars and an expiration date of next Wednesday; this means that at any time
before next Wednesday, I can buy an AAPL stock at that price, regardless of what the price of the stock
(the spot price) currently is. If by next Wednesday the price has risen to $450, then I can buy for $430.30
and sell for $450, thus earning myself a hefty profit. A PUT option is similar, but instead of being a bet
on rising value, it is a bet on falling value, and allows you to sell a stock for a price higher than the spot
price. Options are an incredibly fundamental derivatives, with many traders using exclusively options for
their activities. With this in mind, a question arises very naturally: given some option, how much should
I be willing to pay in order to buy this option? Is the Apple CALL I described previously worth $1, or
$10? If Apple rising to $450 is very likely, then obviously the call must be more expensive, since it nets
a profit of almost $20. However, if there is no chance whatsoever that Apple will rise above $430.30, the
option is near-worthless
