As an efficiency measurement and evaluation methodology, DEA is particularly
useful in cases where sample units, termed decision making units (DMU), use
multiple inputs and outputs, and are operating under comparable conditions. DEA
primarily measures technical efficiency, i.e. focusing on levels of inputs relative to
outputs, as opposed to economic efficiency which would also consider market
prices. The use of levels of inputs and outputs is another powerful characteristic
of DEA, in that it can incorporate inputs and outputs in the natural units in which
they are measured and does not require them to be converted to the same units of
measure â€“ specifically, they are not required to be converted to monetary units.
